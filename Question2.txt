When will we use F1-score instead of precision(accuracy)?
When the target classes are highly imbalance.

Why don’t we use binary classification function as the activation function in neural networks?
Note: binary classification function f(x) = {1 if x > 0 0 if x ≤ 0
The gradient of binary step function is zero. Therefore cannot use backward propagation to update parameters.

What is the bias and variance of a machine learning algorithm?
Bias is a model underfiting the data, can be cause by miss assumption of the model(wrong or too few features)
Variance is a model overfiting the data and therefore sensitive to noise and cannot generalize to unseen data well.

When training a single tree in random forest, we don’t prune the tree, why? 


What is one-hot encoding?
one-hot encoding is an vector representation of catagorical feature. For example, [cat, dog, dog, bird] => [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]

How to prevent overfitting in neural networks? (write down anything you know)
Reduce number of layers or total number of neurons.
Dropout, randomly throw out partial paramters during training
Batchnormalization 
Larger training set
